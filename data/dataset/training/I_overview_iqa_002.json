This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations. 2.~~~~In Zone Sizing (object: \\hyperref[sizingzone]Sizing:Zone) the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in the \\hyperref[sizingzone]Sizing:Zone object. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is a zone sizing factor if specified replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone. 3.~~~~For some plant components (basically all central chillers boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps. a.~~~~For supply side branches the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor. b.~~~For each loop if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1 the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1 the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized). \\subsubsectionMixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs\\labelmixing-user-specified-and-autosized-inputs Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed. 1.~~~~Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components autosized flow rates. For instance specifying the chilled water loop pump s rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller s design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop s autosized maximum loop flow rate. 2.~~~~Within a component it is best"
