interpolation of two of the four standard skies --- \\emph$\\psi$\\(_cs\\) \\emph$\\psi$\\(_ts\\)  \\emph$\\psi$\\(_is\\) and \\emph$\\psi$\\(_os\\) --- described above under ``Sky Luminance Distributions.  The two sky types that are interpolated depend on the value of the sky clearness. The interpolation factors are a function of sky clearness and sky brightness (Perez et al. 1990). Sky clearness is given by: \\beginequation \\varepsilon = \\frac\\fracS_hdif + S_normdirS_hdif + \\kappa Z^31 + \\kappa Z^3 \\endequation where \\emphS\\(_hdif\\) is the diffuse horizontal solar irradiance \\emphS\\(_normdir\\) is the direct normal solar irradiance \\emphZ is the solar zenith angle and \\emph$\\kappa$ is a constant equal to 1.041 for \\emphZ in radians. Sky brightness is given by: \\beginequation \\Delta = S_hdifm/S_normdir^ext \\endequation where \\emphm is the relative optical air mass and \\(S_normdir^ext\\) is the extraterrestrial direct normal solar irradiance. The relative optional air mass is calculated as follows: \\beginequation m = \\frac1- 1\\mathrme-4\\cdot h\\frac\\sin(b) + 0.15(b+3.885)^1.253 \\endequation where $b$ is the Solar Altitude Angle that is the angle of the sun above the horizontal (in degrees) and $h$ is the building altitude (elevation in meters). \\beginequation b = \\frac\\frac\\Pi2 - ZDegToRadians \\endequation  If \\emph$\\varepsilon$ $\\leq$ 1.2 \\beginequation \\psi_isos = s_isos\\psi_is + (1 - s_isos)\\psi_os \\endequation where \\emph$\\psi$\\(_is\\) is the intermediate sky luminance distribution \\emph$\\psi$\\(_os\\) is the overcast sky luminance distribution and \\beginequation s_isos = \\min \\ 1\\max [0(\\varepsilon - 1)/0.2(\\Delta - 0.05)/0.4]\\ \\endequation If 1.2 \\textless\\emph$\\varepsilon$ $\\leq$ 3 \\beginequation \\psi_tsis = s_tsis\\psi_ts + (1 - s_tsis)\\psi_is \\endequation where \\emph$\\psi$\\(_ts\\) is the clear turbid sky luminance distribution and \\beginequation s_tsis = (\\varepsilon - 1.2)/1.8 \\endequation If \\emph$\\varepsilon$ \\textgreater 3 \\beginequation \\psi_csts = s_csts\\psi_cs + (1 - s_csts)\\psi_ts \\endequation where \\emph$\\psi$\\(_cs\\) is the clear sky luminance distribution and \\beginequation s_csts = \\min [1(\\varepsilon - 3)/3] \\endequation \\subsectionInterior Illuminance\\labelinterior-illuminance For each time step the interior illuminance \\emphI\\(_win\\) from a window is calculated as follows by multiplying daylight factors and exterior illuminance. First the sun- and sky-related daylight illuminance factors for the time step are determined by interpolation of the hourly factors: \\beginequation \\bar d_sun(i_Li_S) = w_jd_sun(i_Li_Si_h) + (1 - w_j)d_sun(i_Li_Si_h + 1) \\endequation \\beginequation \\bar d_skyk(i_Li_S) = w_jd_skyk(i_Li_Si_h) + (1 - w_j)d_skyk(i_Li_Si_h + 1) \\endequation where \\emphi\\(_L\\) is the reference point index (1 or 2) \\emphi\\(_S\\) is the window shade index (1 for unshaded window 2 for shaded window) \\emphi\\(_h\\) is the hour number and \\emphk is the sky type index.
